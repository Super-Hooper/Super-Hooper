- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Super-Hooper

I established this repository for the purpose of practicing my programming skills and gaining experience with version control. I would eventually like to become a software developer. The programming languages I'm most interested in are C/C++. 

I also have some experience with Java, HTML5, CSS, SQL, Assembly, and LabVIEW.
